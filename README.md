# Computer-Hardware-Application


My project is to develop a computer equipment Web Application. JavaScript application
using NodeJS. Node.js is a platform for building fast and scalable server applications using
JavaScript. Users can check components prices through my application and browse news about
computer hardware and technology. This program is built by API media News collect, search
algorithm, socket io, chat room, Windows Operating system, Mongoose db database etc.


Get Start Quickly:
The main purpose of this web application is to help users assemble their
own computers. Computer hardware news can improve usersâ€™ awareness
of the software.

Abundant Resources:
This is a Web application like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter etc. First, it
provides news about computer equipment. The latest news comes from
some hardware website, like the hothardware.com. The news comes from
techspot.com, tomshardware.com and wccftech.com. The users can
quickly learn about the latest computer news. We will mark where the
source of the news comes from so that it does not violate copyright
issues.

Searching Engine:
Users can use the keyword bar to search the news about relevant
information about what they interested in. For example, some people just
only want to buy a CPU. I will design a searching engine.
Convenient

Communication:
There is a chatting room. It can provide users to publish or share their
experience of the computer by text. Give other users some of their own
experience to build up a computer. Users can share the plan of
assembling the computer, and others can directly refer to the publisher's
plan. This avoids hardware incompatibility. Assuming they encounter
difficulties on the way to assembly, they can also ask questions and wait
for someone who knows to solve the question.
